## A cheesy story

One day I found a perfectly executed rug on pump.fun.  Really, it was perfect and the original creator of ðŸ§€ rugged it into the stone age.  And I'd recently gotten rugged.  Then I began to wonder about how to make a more stable, less ruggable meme coin.  ðŸ§€ Seemed the perfect template.  So I started to rug ðŸ§€ but without the ruthless efficency of the originator, and with the agreement of the ðŸ§€ community -- to my surprise, people were really interested in this!  So I began to "melt" ðŸ§€ into permanently locked pools that are pretty much incapable of rugging.  ðŸ§€ can fluctuate in price like any asset on capitalist markets, but as the ðŸ§€ matures, it will get harder and harder to make a sudden, negative impact to its price.  

ðŸ§€ has >60 permanently locked liquidity pools on Solana.

Along the way of CTOing ðŸ§€, I noticed that routers did not work as well as thought.   Probably this will lead to some kind of routing product, but that has nothing to do with ðŸ§€.  If you like ðŸ§€, please, enjoy it with us, and melt it into permanent pools with us.
