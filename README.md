## A cheesy story

One day I found a perfectly executed rug on pump.fun.  Really, it was perfect and the original creator of ðŸ§€ rugged it into the stone age.  And I'd recently gotten rugged.  Then I began to wonder about how to make a more stable, less ruggable meme coin.  ðŸ§€ Seemed the perfect template.  ðŸ§€ has >60 permanently locked liquidity pools on Solana.

Along the way of CTOing ðŸ§€, I noticed that routers did not work as well as thought.
